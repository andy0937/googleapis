    The Stackdriver Error Reporting API provides:

    * A simple
    [endpoint](/error-reporting/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects.events/report)
    to **report** errors from your running service.
    * Read access to error groups and their associated errors.

    ## Data model

    The Error Reporting API defines three entities: error events, error
    groups, and error group stats. The [error group
    stats](#error-group-stats)
    object is the object that most users will interact with most frequently.

    ### Error events

    An [`ErrorEvent`](/error-reporting/reference/rest/v1beta1/ErrorEvent)
    represents a single occurrence of an error in your application. The
    object
    contains information about the error, such as the time at which it
    occurred, the context in which it occurred, and the error message that was
    returned.

    ### Error groups

    [`ErrorGroup`](/error-reporting/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects.groups#ErrorGroup) objects
    are logically-grouped collections of error events. Grouping is
    based on information in the error event's stack trace. An error group is a
    simple object containing only the name, group ID, and any associated
    tracking issues for the group.

    To update tracking issues URLs, use this resource's `update` method.

    ### Error group stats

    [`ErrorGroupStats`](/error-reporting/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects.groupStats/list#ErrorGroupStats) objects
    contain detailed information about an error group,
    and are the API objects that you will interact with most frequently.
    Information in the `groupStats` object includes the first and last time an
    error event in this group occurred, the count, the number of affected
    users, and more. This object is useful when building widgets and custom
    dashboards.

    ## Operations

    The Error Reporting API supports the following operations:

    * Report a new error event
    * List error group stats
    * List error events
    * Get error groups * Update an error group's tracking issues

    ### Report error events

    You can report error events from your running services by writing them to
    [`ReportedErrorEvent`](/error-reporting/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects.events/report#ReportedErrorEvent). Doing
    this generates
    [properly formatted error
    messages](/error-reporting/docs/formatting-error-messages) in Stackdriver
    Logging. The resulting log name is formatted as
    `projects/<PROJECT_ID>/clouderrorreporting.googleapis.com%2Freported_errors`. You
    might incur minor Stackdriver Logging ingestion costs using this
    method; to control these costs, review [Logs
    exclusions](/logging/docs/exclusions).

    You can also report new error events to Error Reporting by assembling
    [error event
    entities](/error-reporting/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects.events/report#ReportedErrorEvent) from
    your running service and sending them to the `events.report` method.

    ### List error group stats

    To get a list of error group stats, send a request to the
    [`groupStats.list`](/error-reporting/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects.groupStats/list) method.
    You can pass one or more
    [query
    parameters](/error-reporting/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects.groupStats/list#body.QUERY_PARAMETERS) to
    filter the group stats that are returned.

    ### List error events

    To get a list of error events belonging to a specific error group, send a
    request to the
    [`events.list`](/error-reporting/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects.events/list) method.
    You can pass a filter condition to these requests to retrieve only
    those error events that occurred between a specific start and end time, or
    those that match specific [service
    contexts](/error-reporting/reference/rest/v1beta1/ServiceContextFilter).

    ### Get error groups

    To retrieve a specific error group resource, send a request to the
    [`groups.get`](/error-reporting/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects.groups/get) method. ###
    Update error groups

    To update the tracking issue URLs associated with an error group, send an
    updated
    [`ErrorGroup`
    resource](/error-reporting/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects.groups#ErrorGroup) to
    the
    [`groups.update`](/error-reporting/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects.groups/update) method. <!--
